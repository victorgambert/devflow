Create a formal user story from the following refined requirements:

## Refinement Context

**Business Context:** {{refinementContext}}

**Objectives:** {{refinementObjectives}}

**Preliminary Acceptance Criteria:** (from refinement phase - you should expand and make these more specific)

## Original Task

**Title:** {{taskTitle}}

**Priority:** {{taskPriority}}

## Your Task

Transform this refined information into a complete user story with:

1. **USER STORY** - Write in the standard format (As a... I want... So that...)
   - Who is the actor/user?
   - What do they want to accomplish?
   - Why does it matter to them?

2. **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA** - Write 3-5 specific, testable criteria
   - Each must define a clear pass/fail condition
   - Must be verifiable through testing or demonstration
   - Should cover all key aspects of the story

3. **DEFINITION OF DONE** - List quality standards
   - Code review completed
   - Tests written and passing
   - Documentation updated
   - Any other quality gates

4. **BUSINESS VALUE** - Explain the impact
   - How does this benefit users?
   - What business metrics improve?
   - Why should we prioritize this?

5. **STORY POINTS** - Estimate using Fibonacci (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
   - Consider complexity, uncertainty, and effort
   - Use 5 points as the "ideal" story size
   - Suggest splitting if > 13 points

Remember: Keep language clear and non-technical. Focus on what the user needs, not how it will be built.
