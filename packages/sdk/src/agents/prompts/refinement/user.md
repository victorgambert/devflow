**Description:** {{taskDescription}}

**Priority:** {{taskPriority}}

## Your Analysis

Please provide a comprehensive refinement analysis covering:

1. **BUSINESS CONTEXT** - What problem does this solve? Why is it important?

2. **OBJECTIVES** - What are we trying to achieve? What are the measurable outcomes?

3. **QUESTIONS** - What needs clarification from the Product Owner? What assumptions need validation?

4. **SPLIT SUGGESTION** - Should this be broken down into smaller stories? (if complexity is L or XL)
   - For each proposed sub-story, identify dependencies (which sub-stories must be completed first)
   - For each proposed sub-story, draft specific acceptance criteria

5. **PRELIMINARY CRITERIA** - How will we validate success? What are the acceptance criteria?

6. **COMPLEXITY ESTIMATE** - XS/S/M/L/XL based on scope, uncertainty, and dependencies

Remember: Focus on business needs and clarity, not technical implementation details.
