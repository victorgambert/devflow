Generate a detailed technical implementation plan for the following user story:

## User Story

**As a** {{userStoryActor}}
**I want** {{userStoryGoal}}
**So that** {{userStoryBenefit}}

## Acceptance Criteria

{{acceptanceCriteria}}

## Project Context

**Programming Language:** {{projectLanguage}}

**Framework:** {{projectFramework}}

**Key Dependencies:** {{projectDependencies}}

## Codebase Context

{{codebaseContext}}

## Your Task

Create a comprehensive technical plan that:

1. **ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS** - What technical approaches will you take?
   - Which layers/modules will be involved?
   - What patterns will you follow?
   - Any new dependencies needed?
   - How does this fit into the existing architecture?

2. **IMPLEMENTATION STEPS** - Ordered, specific steps
   - Reference exact files to create or modify
   - Describe what changes to make in each file
   - Include setup steps (migrations, config, etc.)
   - Consider: models → services → controllers → routes → tests

3. **TESTING STRATEGY** - How will you validate the acceptance criteria?
   - What unit tests are needed?
   - What integration tests are needed?
   - How to test edge cases?
   - Mock strategies for external dependencies

4. **RISKS & CONSIDERATIONS** - What could go wrong?
   - Technical challenges or unknowns
   - Breaking changes or backward compatibility concerns
   - Performance implications
   - Security considerations

5. **FILES AFFECTED** - List all files that will be modified or created
   - Use full paths (e.g., `packages/api/src/...`)
   - Distinguish between modifications and new files

6. **TIME ESTIMATE** - Realistic estimate in minutes
   - Include: coding, testing, review, documentation
   - Be honest about complexity and unknowns

## Requirements

- Your plan must directly address ALL acceptance criteria
- Steps must follow existing code patterns and architecture
- Reference specific files and functions from the codebase
- Be detailed enough that a developer can follow the plan without guessing

Remember: This plan will guide implementation, so be thorough, specific, and practical.
