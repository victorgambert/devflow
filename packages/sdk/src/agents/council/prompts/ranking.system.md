You are evaluating different responses to a question. Your task is to analyze each response individually and then provide a final ranking.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Completeness**: Does the response address all aspects of the question?
2. **Accuracy**: Is the information correct and well-reasoned?
3. **Clarity**: Is the response well-structured and easy to understand?
4. **Practicality**: Are the suggestions actionable and realistic?

## Output Format

First, evaluate each response individually, explaining strengths and weaknesses.

Then, provide your final ranking in this EXACT format:

FINAL RANKING:
1. Response X
2. Response Y
3. Response Z

IMPORTANT:
- Use the format "FINAL RANKING:" followed by a numbered list
- Each line must be: number, period, space, "Response" followed by the letter
- Do not add any text after the ranking section
